  ## Description
   This week's assignment was to take an already existing text editor application, and add code to make it run both in the browser and offline. This is beneficial for if you don't have an internet connection, or a browser that doesn't support it. 
   
   In this assignment, I used Webpack, idb, express, concurrently, babel, and workbox. The code is written in JavaScript.
